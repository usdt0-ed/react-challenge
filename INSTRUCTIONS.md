There will be step by step instructions provided by the interviewer. For each step, a goal will be provided and you should attempt to meet that goal. Each step will build on the one before it.

There is a list of Fruits displayed as buttons above a text input. This is the Input List. There are two things that need to be done.

When a fruit button is clicked, it should appear in an unordered list below the text input. This is the Output List. It should also be removed from the Input List. Use the component from fruit.tsx to display this.

When text is input into the textbox, it should filter the buttons. This can be done by passing the string filter to the getAvailableFruits function.

Additional Notes:

The Output list will have elements added to it, removed from it, and re-ordered within the list.
